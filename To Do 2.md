# List of things to do before adding users feature
- write tests for client-side
- write tests for server-side
- change colour scheme
- figure out if the images are cached or if a new request is made each time
- indicate currently selected colour
- change mouse icon to brush when hovering over the canvas
- figure out how to support annotation in mobile, currently, the implementation is mousemove, which mobile doesn't have?
- add click to show image info, credit, artist name, link?
- decide whether image should continue as links or be uploaded
    - oh maybe, if it is uploaded, maybe as base64, maybe the server can process it so it is smaller in size?
